# Password-challenge-

## Description
This application helps the user generate a "secure" randomized password to be used for all of their password needs. Using if statements, for loops, and functions, it generates a unique password that contains lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters! 

## Usage
To use this website, simply click on the "Generate Password" button. Prompts will begin appearing asking you different questions about your password such as password length and character type. Once you have completed all of the prompts, a randomized password will appear on the screen!
