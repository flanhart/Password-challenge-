Badges
Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by shields.io. You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

If your project has a lot of features, consider adding a heading called "Features" and list them there.
